# professional-portfolio

## Description

This is my amateur's attempt at implementing and show-casing what coding know-how I've learned so far. I started this portfolio barely understanding CSS styling and all the different ways to layout and format a webpage. But through this endeavor, I've come to learn that there's multiple ways to find a solution to any one problem. I've learned that button animations and opaque text boxes are more difficult than first perceived. Keep moving forward, always retrace your steps, never give up, and above all else, commit all changes to your main github repository every hour.
